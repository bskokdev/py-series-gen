# PySeriesGen - Python Data Generator
A flexible Python-based data generation tool that creates and publishes data streams using Python generators. This tool is designed to be extensible and configurable through command-line arguments, and custom generator functions.

## Features
- üîÑ Streaming data generation using Python generator functions (only time series generator available for now)
- üéØ Multiple publish targets support (currently Console, and Kafka)
- ‚ö° Efficient batch processing
- üõ†Ô∏è Configurable through CLI arguments
- üîå Extensible architecture for adding new publish targets

## Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/bskokdev/py-series-gen.git

# Navigate to the generator directory
cd py-series-gen/generator

# Install dependencies
# Consider creating a virtual environment before running this step
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

#### Default Arguments
`--target <TARGET_TYPE>` - Specifies the publish target (e.g., console, kafka)
`--batch-size <DATA_SIZE>` - Sets the size of data batches to generate
`--stream` - Enables streaming mode. For now this means, the batches are sent repeatedly to the target.

#### Kafka Arguments
`--bootstrap-server <SERVER_ADDRESS>` - Tells the program where is the Kafka bootstrap-server running
`--port <PORT>` - On which port the bootstrap-server runs
`--topic <KAFKA TOPIC>` - Specifies the topic the data should be generated to

If you more need help, you can use `--help` argument to view all supported arguments, and usages.

## Testing 

For testing I've used pytest, since it has a good support for fixtures, allows custom marks, and is generally very simple to use, and provides more features than the unittest Python module. 

Currently there are defined 2 custom marks:
* `unit_test` - this annonates the unit tests
* `integration_test` - this annonates the integrations tests


#### How to run tests
NOTE: some tests are disabled locally, as they would take too long to pass, and that's quite annoying.

```bash
# To run the tests ... make sure you are in the /generator directory, or you will get warnings
python3 -m pytest
```


### Examples
```bash
# Stream batches of data to the console, each batch contains 2048 values
python3 py_series_gen.py --target console --batch-size 2048 --stream

# Generate a single batch of 1000 values to the console
python3 py_series_gen.py --target console --batch-size 1000

# Stream batches of size 32 to the `py-topic` Kafka topic which is present at localhost:9092
python3 py_series_gen.py --target kafka --batch-size 32 --bootstrap-server localhost --port 9092 --topic py-topic --stream
```

### Architecture
The generator is built with a modular architecture (see docs for more). The 3 main concepts are Publishers, Targets, and generator functions. Both Publishers, and Targers are generated dynamically from the CLI arguments by their respective factories. The generator functions are implemented for each supported publish target.

- Publish Targets: Handle the state for different destinations
- Publishers: These are responsible for the actual data sending to the data destinations
- Generator Functions: Produce the actual data (e.g., time_series_generator)

### Extending
For adding new targets:
1. Create a new target class implementing the target interface
2. Register the new target in the factory
3. Add CLI support for the new target

## What are the publishers?

A publisher is an object which handles all the data sending to the specific target
- The publisher's target is defined as its field, so it can access all the required arguments, and value in order to publish the data to its destination

Same as for the target, the publisher is dynamically generated by a factory based on the `TargetType` value.

For example:
`--type console` will generate a `ConsolePublisher` publisher which inherits from the base `Publisher` class. However, this `ConsolePublisher` contains the specific `ConsoleTarget`, and publish method which allows publishing to the console output.
